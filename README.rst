ftw.usermanagement
==================

This package allows users to easily manage users and groups through
a new view without having plone's manage portal permission. This is useful
when the person who manages users and groups should have full manager access
to the site.

If the user has the permission "Manage users", a new action is displayed in
the user menu, giving him the ability to list and modify users and groups.

  - List users
  - Assign users to groups
